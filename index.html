    <h2>Synopsis</h2>
    <h3>Ctrl-Cloud is a multi-platform software developed to unify all your copy and paste needs! 
        From your desktop to your phone, you can seamlessly move snippets of text, images, and videos 
        without any hassle! The simplicity of the mobile application will be how the user has access
        to a “chat-styled” feature that contains the full functionality to copy, paste and share their findings.
    </h3>
    
    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <h3>We ambitiously desire to design and implement a cross-platform software that integrates a seamless copy-paste 
        feature. We have chosen our platforms based upon what we feel we have the most experience in. We believe our 
        strengths revolve around Java, Ruby, HTML/CSS, and Android which should provide us with the knowledge base to 
        produce a user friendly and fully functioning application.
